### **Custom ML vs. Off-the-Shelf LLM**:

| **Aspect**                | **Custom ML**                    | **Off-the-Shelf LLM**           |
|---------------------------|----------------------------------|---------------------------------|
| **Staffing Cost**          | Higher due to specialized roles  | Lower due to pre-built models   |
| **Model Training**         | Requires significant resources   | Minimal, if any, required       |
| **Project Completion**     | Longer due to development time   | Faster with pre-trained models  |
| **Infrastructure Cost**    | Higher for dedicated resources   | Lower, cloud-based solutions    |
| **LLM Model Cost**         | Potentially higher for custom solutions | Standard pricing, pay-as-you-go |
