FAITH DRIVEN ENTREPRENEUR
HOW THE GOSPEL SHAPES OUR CALL TO CREATE

SESSION 4
EXCELLENCE MATTERS

Welcome back to the faith driven

entrepreneur video series.

It's awesome to have you with us.

Today we're going to talk about excellence.

How it's incredibly important

that we do our work really, really well,

because there's going to be
a lot of people watching us.

But first, a great video
from one of my favorite

faith driven entrepreneurs,

Don Flow.

Watch with me please.

(serene music)

When I first came out of college,

my dad asked me if I wanted to consider

coming back with him in

a Volkswagen dealership we owned.

And I told him that

I first wanted to go to
graduate school in theology

because I wanted to ground my faith

much more biblically and theologically

as I went forward,

and then that I wanted to do

every job in the dealership,

and I wanted to get paid just like it.

I remember working as a technician,

and I'd been a really
good student along the way,

and I was a very average technician,

and I remember struggling and one time

I'm working on this exhaust manifold,

intake manifold,

and I get rust in my eyes,

it's burning up hot,

and I'm like why am I doing this?

I could be in graduate school right now.

I could have collinear.

and I'm doing this right now?

But my idea was I want
to actually experience

the struggles everybody went through
when they did their jobs.

I did that for four years,

and then I went back to
graduate business school.

I began to develop some basic premise,

and one of them was that

what space had God
given me to have influence.

What does it mean for me to actually

live love in that setting?

And what does it mean
to actually bring hope

to these people's lives and
encourage them as people?

You can be in the car
business a lot of places,

but if you want to do
it differently and better,

and you want to provide a very,

very different experience for people,

this is about the only
place you can do that.

Everything that we do is about

building trust with our customers,

and I think Don has done a good job of

instilling that in his management,

in his leaders in the company.

How we take care of our customers,

how we take care of
each other as employees,

and also how we look to serve

the community that we live and work in.

This is for a lot of
people the second most,

and for some people the most

expensive purchase
they're ever going to make.

So to me what's different about that

is that we care that we're going to affect

their whole life if we do this wrong.

We looked in terms of biblical language

and said what do we want to be about,

how does that give expression

to what we're trying to do now in terms of,

what would be animating the culture

or ethos residing our business.

We said the first thing has to be trust.

And to be a person or an organization

that's trustworthy we have to ask

what does that actually mean?

If you came in for service
what would that look like?

If you came in and bought a car
from us what would that look like?

And we deconstructed
everything we did in the business.

Everything all the way.

So you entrust your car to us,

and you're at a really disadvantage,

you don't know anything about cars,

and you can't get around
if you don't have a car,

so it's pretty easy for somebody
to take advantage of somebody else.

What would that look like for us
to say that could never happen here?

And we came out and said,

we can only give you one estimate,

so if we came back with more
then we had to basically eat that.

It means that if we didn't fix it right
the first time, you never pay it again.

It meant that you couldn't
be inconvenienced.

We'd go pick up your car
and bring it back to you,

and the price that we quoted would
never be more than that no matter what.

No matter if we made a mistake or not,
it would be done one time.

Some of the things that people

experience out in the industry,

is just the hiding of information.

We do the opposite.

We want to tell them every single thing.

So us being profitable is not about us

having more information than the customer.

It's about us giving value
and providing a really,

really fantastic service for people,

not only when they buy their car
but long after when they service their car.

If negotiation is basically

based on asymmetrical knowledge,

in the sense that I know
something you don't know

and I can use that against you,
then we can't do that anymore.

So we change the whole way cars are priced,

how we came to market,

instead of starting at the top
and negotiating down price,

we came right up front with a price.

We like the way we appraise cars too.

We went to the open book,
so you can see how we arrived at the price.

In the financing world,

long before there were caps on financing,

we said we have to cap it.

It doesn't make any
difference what the law is.

We have to cap it,

because we said your ability to negotiate
should not determine the price you pay.

It should be the same offer everybody gets.

Warranties on our used cars,

we put a 100,000 mile
warranty on a used car.

So we have to figure
how to manage that cost.

That meant we had to get better reconditioning,
so we developed a very detailed process

so we knew with confidence
the car would really last.

And then we put a money back guarantee,

because we said that's what
you would if your neighbor,

you'd be able to offer
something back again.

And people said I must
be crazy to do all that.

Well, if I said I was really
going to treat a person

like my neighbor or like a guest in my home

that's what I would do,

so why aren't we doing that?

How do we kind of reengage
in the trust relationships?

Trust has underneath it,

keeping your promises,

always regardless of the cost.

It means that you would never advantage

yourself with the disadvantage of another.

It means there can never be
any language that's manipulative,

deceptive or puts you at a disadvantage.

So if you said you can
make a trillion dollars

but we can't treat
people like this anymore,

or we can't treat customers like that,
well then I just don't want to make it.

That's not success for us.

Success has to begin in terms of

we can be trusted to always do

the right thing for our customer.

A place that a person comes to work,

they invest their scarce
labor capital with me,

and they get a full return for
their life for having done so.

And we're a place that our communities,

that we really enhance
the communities we're in.

That we're a place that,

if we didn't exist,

people wish we were there.

Faith is something that
we actually exercise.

It's not an abstract concept.

And so how do we actually exercise faith?

And love is something we actually live.

It's not an abstraction, all right,
but it's actually a live movement in life,

and hope is something we actually

bring in our very presence.

And so we want to connect those

to people's lives and say how do we help

this be a place that's worth believing in?

How is this a place where you believe

you make a contribution

and you make a difference once you do?

And how can this be a place where

you feel connected as a human being?

The Christian philosopher Francis Schaeffer
once said that our opportunity to be heard

by the lost world would be directly

related to how well we do our work.

You know, many people
don't think about the connection

between excellent work and our witness,

but I can guarantee you
that non-Christians see it.

The Apostle Peter said
in his letter First Peter

that we ought to live
our lives in such a way

that people ask about our motivations.

What is it that drives us to
such excellence in our work?

Such high standards
in our ethical dealings,

even if nobody else is watching.

Listen, if your witness was the only reason

to pursue your business with excellence,

it would be worth it.

But here's the thing.

External witness is not the only reason.

There's an even greater reason

to pursue excellence in our work.

In Colossians 3:23-24
the Apostle Paul writes,

you know, whatever you do,

you should do it from the heart.

As something done for the Lord,
and not just for people.

Knowing that you will receive the reward

of an inheritance from the Lord himself,

because you, you don't
just serve your boss.

You don't just serve your customers.

You serve the Lord Christ.

If our work is done for the Lord,
then it should be done according

to the highest standards
of excellence, right?

I mean, our work by itself, Paul says,

is an offering to God.

Even if it doesn't have bible verses

or Christian slogans attached to it.

Just think on that.

Your work is like an offering

that you are going to
present at the throne of God.

Is the quality of your work

befitting of the majesty of God?

Would you be embarrassed to lay down

your work at God's feet?

Does the excellence of your work

point people to the excellence of God?

I know a few business
people in our community

who say that they actually don't like

partnering with Christian businesses,

because those businesses aren't reliable.

They don't honor deadlines,

as if Christian grace demands the excusing

of sloppiness or a lack of professionalism.

I'll just tell you,

that is flat out wrong.

That is not a Christian approach

to work and to business.

Christian entrepreneurs
ought to be producing

something of quality and reliability

that points people to the
goodness and excellence of God.

Christian entrepreneurs ought to pursue

excellence in their businesses,

not simply because they want
to increase their bottom line,

but because what they do is first

and foremost an offering to Christ.

Because we report to a higher authority,

we seek to serve him with

the highest quality work possible.

Think about it.

Can't we safely assume
that no wobbly chairs

came out of the carpenter shop in Nazareth?

Before Jesus preached the kingdom
to the glory of God on a hillside,

he made chairs for the glory
of God at a carpenter shop.

So we've got to follow
the example of our savior

and seek excellence in every aspect

of our entrepreneurial journey.

Knowing that our business
endeavors are primarily for God

also is going to add new
significance to what we do.

Especially during the difficult season.

When you know that God is watching,

it changes your approach
to those periods in business

or your enterprise where
it feels like nobody else is.

Whether everyone else is praising you

for a grand new initiative

or you're struggling to
get your first investor,

you know that you're working
first and foremost for Christ,

and he's always the same and
he always deserves your best.

C.S. Lewis, the Oxford don
and Christian philosopher,

once noted how explorers
going into the New World

would sometimes lay their eyes on a valley

that they assumed no human
eyes had ever beheld before,

and they would see that it was filled
with all these incredible stunning flowers

and natural beauty that they
assumed nobody had ever seen.

And Lewis said that meant for years and
years these valleys flourished in beauty

with no human eyes to behold that beauty.

Was that beauty wasted, Lewis asked.

Well, no.

No, C.S. Lewis said,

because God does some
things for his own pleasure,

and God sees even when nobody else does.

Well, see, the same is true of our work
whether anybody sees it or not.

God sees it even when nobody else does.

For many of you as
entrepreneurs and business owners,

you have a unique opportunity,

not only to display excellence,

but you can also help cultivate

a culture of excellence,

which in and of itself glorifies God.

Every decision you make is going to impact

an entire range of people.

It's going to impact your investors,
your customers,

your employees,

just to name a few.

Are you going to make decisions that take
care of them or ones that just benefit you?

Doing excellent work is a
way of serving and loving

all the people impacted
by what you are creating.

And what you do as the entrepreneur.

You multiply in the
lives of those around you.

You know this.

That the kind of business you run,
the kind of work that you do,

is going to impact how people learn
to do business and how they learn to think.

It's going to create a culture that's
going to impact not just their work lives,

but all of their lives.

Their personal lives.

You get the unique opportunities

to set that tone in your organization.

So which one are you going to set?

Is it going to be one that's marked by
a ruthless pursuit of the bottom line?

Or is it going to be one
marked by good enough work?

Or is it going to be
one viewed as a service

to others where excellence is both modeled,

encouraged and celebrated
as an offering to God.

Excellence doesn't just happen.

You know that.

Excellence is,

in the words of Eugene Peterson,

the result of a long obedience
in the same direction,

but it gets easier when
we see the bigger purpose,

and that is that our excellence
serves those around us,

and glorifies the God who is above us.

What this means is that a
Christian's excellent work

helps to bring God's presence to the world.

God is active through a person's work

to ensure that families are fed,

that homes are built,

and that justice is carried out.

Too many Christians begrudge
their work when they ought

to revel in the fact that God

is using them in whatever small way

to fulfill his purposes on Earth.

Is that how you see your work?

I love that quote from Francis Schaeffer.

Which he talks about effectively,

it's to the degree that
we do our work well,

that we have an opportunity
to witness and be heard.

I hope that you'll come back to the website
faithdrivenentrepreneur.org.

We've got a daily blog,

a weekly podcast,

a monthly newsletter,

and you'll interact with us.

And then also you'll get
together in groups of people

and talk about what does it look like
to be excellent in the work we do.

Do we look like the mediocre service person

that's got a fish on her van?

Or are we leading with excellence?

Is our work such that people see what we're
doing and want to find out what makes us tick?

And why is it that we do our work so well?

So, look forward to seeing you next time.

Thanks for joining us.
