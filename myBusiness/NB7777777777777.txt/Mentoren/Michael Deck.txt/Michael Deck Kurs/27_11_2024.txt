**Leading with a Limp**

We often try to act like everything is under control. But the problem with this attitude is that eventually, it leads us to rely on facades rather than honesty. The truth is, we can't do it alone. God doesn’t ask for perfection—He wants our honest hearts. The terrifying reality is that if we don’t humble ourselves, God might remind us who is truly in control. So, what would it take for us to stop pretending and start showing others—and God—the truth about what’s really happening in our lives?

Let’s watch a video that shows how God can use brokenness to make a real difference.

**SEATTLE PACIFIC UNIVERSITY: The Beauty of Brokenness**

The story begins with a couple on the verge of collapse. Within a year of their son being born, they were just three days away from divorce. One of them was struggling with drug addiction, and they were $99,000 in debt. Life seemed hopeless. Thoughts of suicide filled their minds—"This life isn’t worth living."

But in their darkest moment, they cried out to God. “Oh my God, You’ve been here all along!” That realization changed everything. Although initial attempts to reconcile were met with skepticism—“You’re lying. You’re just trying to manipulate me to stay”—things slowly began to shift. Later that year, they discovered they were expecting another child, but heartbreak struck when they lost the baby at eight weeks. This tragedy led to a turning point: surrendering everything to God.

Through years of counseling and small steps of faith, they rebuilt their lives. Their marriage, once a symbol of failure, became a beacon of hope for others facing similar struggles. Their story showed that even in brokenness, there is beauty, and with God, there is always hope.

**Building a Community of Hope**

With newfound purpose, they started small, working odd jobs and slowly building a life. They moved to a small town and poured their hearts into the community. Over time, their efforts grew into a thriving business that included a construction company, multiple restaurants, and a real estate firm focused on restoring cities.

Their vision was simple but powerful: foster trust and understanding among neighbors. By helping people rediscover hope in their towns, they inspired transformation in communities of all sizes—from populations of 800 to 80,000. They realized that true, lasting change requires three kinds of capital:  
1. **Patience** – Transformation takes years of investment.  
2. **Proper alignment** – People must share a common vision and values.  
3. **Productivity** – Sustainable success must balance profit and purpose.

Their dream is to create communities that flourish for generations—places that reflect God’s love and hope.

**The Story of Jacob: Leading with a Limp**

The biblical story of Jacob is one of transformation. Born as 
the younger son, Jacob was at a disadvantage. By Jewish custom, 
the inheritance went to the older brother, Esau. This fueled 
Jacob’s insatiable drive to succeed, even through deceit and ruthlessness.

But Jacob’s life reached a breaking point. He found himself 
at a low, facing family conflict and personal failure. One night, 
as he wrestled with despair, God appeared to him in the form of an 
angel. Jacob fought all night, but he couldn’t win. This encounter 
taught Jacob a profound lesson: he couldn’t do everything on his own. 
From that moment on, Jacob walked with a limp—a physical reminder of 
his dependence on God.

The best leaders are those who have learned to “lead with a limp.” They 
recognize their weaknesses and rely on God for strength. They no longer 
feel the need to be ruthless or to sacrifice their integrity for success. 
Instead, they walk humbly with God, trusting Him to provide.

**The Core of It All: God's Grace**

The most important truth is that we are all broken by sin 
and unable to save ourselves. But God, in His love, sent 
Jesus to live the life we couldn’t live and die the death 
we deserved. Salvation is a gift we can’t earn—it's an act 
of grace.

There’s good news and bad news:  
- **The bad news:** We’re separated from God by our sin.  
- **The worse news:** There’s nothing we can do to fix it on our own.  
- **The good news:** Jesus has already done it for us.  
- **The best news:** All we have to do is accept this gift.

God still takes broken lives and does amazing things with them. 
There is hope. The question is, will you embrace it? Will you 
surrender to God and trust Him with your life?

**Conclusion**

Leading with a limp means acknowledging our weaknesses and 
trusting God to guide us. It’s about surrendering control 
and walking humbly in faith. When we do this, we find that 
our brokenness isn’t a barrier—it’s the very thing God uses 
to create beauty and inspire hope in others.
